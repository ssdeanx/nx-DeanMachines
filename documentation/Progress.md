# NxDeanMachines Project Progress

## Current Status: Initial Setup Phase

**Last Updated:** March 21, 2025

## Completed

- âœ… Created Nx workspace with integrated preset
- âœ… Generated initial dashboard application with Vite bundler
- âœ… Set up comprehensive VS Code configurations for optimal Nx development
- âœ… Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality enforcement
- âœ… Created knowledge base for project architecture and command references
- âœ… Prepared directory structure for planned library categorization
- âœ… Documented development workflow in README.md
- âœ… Implemented VS Code tasks for common Nx commands

## In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Dashboard application UI development
- ðŸ”„ Library scaffolding for core functionality
- ðŸ”„ Setting up basic CI/CD workflow

## Next Steps

1. **Library Implementation**

   - Generate core UI library in `libs/ui` # card, button, form, card so far
   - Create utility library in `libs/util` for shared helper functions
   - Implement data models in `libs/model`

2. **Application Development**

   - Enhance dashboard with proper routing
   - Implement core UI components
   - Connect with shared libraries

3. **DevOps & Quality**
   - Complete CI/CD pipeline implementation
   - Establish code quality gates
   - Set up Nx Cloud for distributed caching and task execution
