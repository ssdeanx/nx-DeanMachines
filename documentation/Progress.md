**Last Updated:** March 21, 2025

## Progress: 35%

## Completed

- âœ… Created Nx workspace with integrated preset
- âœ… Generated initial dashboard application with Vite bundler
- âœ… Set up comprehensive VS Code configurations for optimal Nx development
- âœ… Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality enforcement
- âœ… Created knowledge base for project architecture and command references
- âœ… Prepared directory structure for planned library categorization
- âœ… Documented development workflow in README.md
- âœ… Implemented VS Code tasks for common Nx commands
- âœ… Fixed ESLint configuration issues in `libs/ui`, `libs/model`, and `libs/util`
- âœ… Verified `tsconfig` files for proper project linking
- âœ… Resolved `nx sync` and workspace synchronization issues

## In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Dashboard application UI development
- ðŸ”„ Library scaffolding for core functionality
- ðŸ”„ Setting up basic CI/CD workflow

## Next Steps

1. **Library Implementation**

   - Generate core UI library in `libs/ui` # card, button, form, card so far
   - Create utility library in `libs/util` for shared helper functions
   - Implement data models in `libs/model`

2. **Application Development**

   - Enhance dashboard with proper routing
   - Implement core UI components
   - Connect with shared libraries

3. **DevOps & Quality**
   - Complete CI/CD pipeline implementation
   - Establish code quality gates
   - Set up Nx Cloud for distributed caching and task execution

## Next Session Focus

1. **UI Library Development**

   - Finalize button component implementation
   - Add card and form components to `libs/ui`
   - Ensure proper TypeScript and ESLint configurations

2. **Utility Library Setup**

   - Create shared utility functions in `libs/util`
   - Add unit tests for utility functions

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Configure Nx Cloud for task caching
